Have been working with React for a bit, and wanted to go back to EJS with this project as a refresher..

will update the readme as I progress! 

Trying something different and pushing to heroku, while pushing completed parts to github, mainly to see if anything breaks on heroku, that is not broken locally. 

Looks like hell right now but is functional!! https://library-crud-ejs.herokuapp.com/
